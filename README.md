## 📝 Assumptions

- Users must have a Google, GitHub, or Facebook account to use the app.
- For simplicity, all users have equal access (no role-based access).
- Only basic validation is implemented; advanced features like password reset and email verification are out of scope for this hackathon.
- JWT is chosen for authentication to simplify deployment on stateless platforms.
